## Introduction and Background
The US housing market has seen significant shortages, affecting various demographics, including college students. Rising inflation, increased mortgage rates, and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated housing issues, leading to a nationwide shortage of 2.3 million housing units between 2012 and 2022. This project narrows down the scope to housing shortages in college towns and their impact on rental prices near campuses. Studies show that one in five students experiences housing insecurity, adding to their financial burdens. The focus is on evaluating whether rental companies are exploiting students with excessive fees.

## Objectives and Goals
The primary objective is to determine if rental companies are exploiting college students by imposing high fees. Using Zillow rental data, the project aims to identify disparities in affordable housing options for students in various college towns across the United States. The stakeholders include students, construction firms, and local governing bodies in cities with colleges or universities. The ultimate goal is to assist students in finding affordable housing and provide insights to construction companies and local authorities about housing shortages in these areas.

## Datasets
Two primary datasets from Zillow were used:
1. **Rental_Data_Zillow:** Monitors housing price indices and new property listings across various metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US from January 2015 to August 2023.
2. **New Property Listings Data:** Records new property listings per month from March 2018 to August 2023, covering 925 cities in the US.

## Data Story
### Local Data Dashboard
The dashboard integrates a map, line chart, and scatterplot to provide insights into rental increases, new listings, and average median rental prices over time.

### Map
Focuses on Indiana cities with college towns, comparing average median rental rates in 2019 and 2023.

### Line Chart
Illustrates rental price trends in Indiana college towns from 2019 to 2023, with a projection for 2024.

### Scatter Plot
Shows the relationship between new property listings and rental prices in Indiana college towns.

### Horizontal Bar (Median Rental Prices)
Compares average monthly median rental prices across the US over six years, with a focus on the notable price spike from 2020 to 2021.

### Crosstab
Displays average median rental prices for each state across different years, using a heat map for visual clarity.

### Horizontal Bar (Number of Listings)
Analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on listing numbers, comparing data from 2020 and 2023.

## Summary
The report analyzes the impact of the housing shortage on rental prices in college towns. The findings show steep rental price increases since 2020 in Indiana college towns like Bloomington, Fort Wayne, Lafayette, and South Bend, indicating a supply-demand imbalance driving up costs for students.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that college students are negatively impacted by inflated rental prices in college towns. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened existing housing shortages, leading to unaffordable rent hikes. More construction of affordable student housing units is needed, and collaboration between colleges, local governments, and housing providers is essential to ease the financial burden on students.
